❤️ Music, books & ~~existential dread~~philosophy, aports & outdoors 🏋🥊🚴🏃🏂🏔⛺, open-source software & decomposing engineering puzzles.

🎉 Fun facts: lived in a recording studio inside a former bomb shelter (and even owned a tiny part of it), studied at a college of music twice—and dropped out twice as well, have three tattoos quoting Dostoevsky in one way or another, always follow the irrational urge to put a piano in every place I call home, hold two MSc degrees in tech (anything to dodge the real work), for a long time, my bench was bigger than my squat (yes, I’m looking at you with shame).
