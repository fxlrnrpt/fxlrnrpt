# Hello ~~darkness my old friend~~ there 👋

ℹ️ My name is Andrey. AI research padawan. Engineer at heart. Rock star wannabe. Proudly sharing my failures along the way.

🧪 Applied research engineer at [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/) ([CV](https://faillearnrepeat.net/cv)). Ex: DevX and tooling at Meta, web perf and tech lead at startups and consultancies.      
Bridging research rigor (applied interpretability, post-training) and engineering discipline across ML, infrastructure, and developer experience.    

🎵 In 2024 released an [EP](https://notsoalive.faillearnrepeat.net/) recorded almost 10 years ago with a friend. Composed, wrote lyrics, played drums, did sound production. Now actively learning how to sign to finally have my own voice.

🤓 Blog about life, career, and tech [in English](https://blog.faillearnrepeat.net/) and [in Russian](https://t.me/fail_learn_repeat). Fighting my stage fright [at conferences](https://github.com/fxlrnrpt/talks). Founded [BeerJS](https://github.com/beerjs/voronezh) in my home town - Voronezh. [Occasional program committee member](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G1KiWarMH9J1rRToRJFnbTwyOcwOXU056g0INIkT4_w/edit?usp=sharing).

❤️ Music, books & ~~existential dread~~philosophy, sports & outdoors 🏋🥊🚴🏃🏂🏔⛺, open-source software & decomposing engineering puzzles.

🎉 Fun facts: lived in a recording studio in an ex-bomb shelter (and even owned a tiny part of it), have three tattoos quoting Dostoevsky in one way or another, always follow the irrational urge to put a piano in every place I call home.

📌 London 🇬🇧 ([UK Global Talent alumni](https://github.com/fxlrnrpt/uk-global-talent-visa-guide)). Ex: Voronezh 🇷🇺, Moscow 🇷🇺.
